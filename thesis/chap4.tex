\subsection{Thin Strip Graphs}

$c$-strip graphs are unit disk graphs such that the centers of the disks are delimited on the area $\{(x,y) : -\infty < x < \infty, 0 < y \leq c\}$ and its class noted SG($c$). We can say that SG(0) = UIG and SG($\infty$) = UDG. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}

\begin{defn}
  Thin strip graphs are defined as TSG $= \bigcap_{c > 0}$ SG($c$).
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
  SG($0$) $\neq$ TSG. We can construct a $K_{1,3}$ such that we have 3 vertices with the coordinates
  $(1,0)$, $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$ and a last one $(0,\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon > 0$ as seen in Figure \ref{fig:thinK13}.
\end{remark}

It has been proven that MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG.\\


Denote that there's not constant $t$ such that SG($t$) = TSG.\\

Unfettered unit interval graphs = UUIG\\

MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG $\subsetneq$ UUIG\\

UUIG $\subseteq$ co-comparability graphs (to prove).

In the following sections we state the problems that are being studied for the thesis.

\subsubsection{Forbidden subgraphs of Thin Strip Graphs}
  We've proven that MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG $\subsetneq$ UUIG. Knowing the\\
  (Why $F_k$ is a co-comparability unit disk graph?)

\subsubsection{Complexity class of TSG recognition}
  We've shown in section \ref{sec:complex} that some intersection geometric
  problems are in $\exists \mathbb{R}$ (unit disk graph recognition problem or
  the art gallery problem) and we'd like to know if
  TSG recognition or even SG($c$) recognition is in $NP$ knowing that TSG
  $\subseteq$ UDG.
