\section{Thin Strip Graphs}

$c$-strip graphs are unit disk graphs such that the centers of the disks are delimited on the area $\{(x,y) : -\infty < x < \infty, 0 < y \leq c\}$ and its class noted SG($c$). We can say that SG(0) = UIG and SG($\infty$) = UDG. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}

Thin strip graphs are defined as $\bigcap_{c > 0}$ SG($c$).

$K_{1,3}$ in TSG, which is not possible for UIG.

MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG.

Denote that there's not constant $t$ such that SG($t$) = TSG. 

Unfettered unit interval graphs = UUIF

\begin{definition}
  Find forbidden induced graphs for TSG.
