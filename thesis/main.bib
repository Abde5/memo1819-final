  abstract = {A unit disk graph is the intersection graph of disks of equal radii in the plane. The class of unit disk graphs is hereditary, and therefore admits a characterization in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. In spite of quite active study of unit disk graphs very little is known about minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for this class. We found only finitely many minimal non unit disk graphs in the literature. In this paper we study in a systematic way forbidden induced subgraphs for the class of unit disk graphs. We develop several structural and geometrical tools, and use them to reveal infinitely many new minimal non unit disk graphs. Further we use these results to investigate structure of co-bipartite unit disk graphs. In particular, we give structural characterization of those co-bipartite unit disk graphs whose edges between parts form a C4-free bipartite graph, and show that bipartite complements of these graphs are also unit disk graphs. Our results lead us to propose a conjecture that the class of co-bipartite unit disk graphs is closed under bipartite complementation.},

  title = {The {{Art Gallery Problem}} Is \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{\vphantom\}{{R}}\vphantom\{\}\$-Complete},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06969},
  abstract = {We prove that the art gallery problem is equivalent under polynomial time reductions to deciding whether a system of polynomial equations over the real numbers has a solution. The art gallery problem is a classical problem in computational geometry. Given a simple polygon \$P\$ and an integer \$k\$, the goal is to decide if there exists a set \$G\$ of \$k\$ guards within \$P\$ such that every point \$p$\backslash$in P\$ is seen by at least one guard \$g$\backslash$in G\$. Each guard corresponds to a point in the polygon \$P\$, and we say that a guard \$g\$ sees a point \$p\$ if the line segment \$pg\$ is contained in \$P\$. The art gallery problem has stimulated extensive research in geometry and in algorithms. However, the complexity status of the art gallery problem has not been resolved. It has long been known that the problem is \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}\$-hard, but no one has been able to show that it lies in \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}\$. Recently, the computational geometry community became more aware of the complexity class \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$. The class \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$ consists of problems that can be reduced in polynomial time to the problem of deciding whether a system of polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real variables has a solution. It can be easily seen that \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}$\backslash$subseteq $\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$. We prove that the art gallery problem is \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$-complete, implying that (1) any system of polynomial equations over the real numbers can be encoded as an instance of the art gallery problem, and (2) the art gallery problem is not in the complexity class \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}\$ unless \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}=$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$. As a corollary of our construction, we prove that for any real algebraic number \$$\backslash$alpha\$ there is an instance of the art gallery problem where one of the coordinates of the guards equals \$$\backslash$alpha\$ in any guard set of minimum cardinality. That rules out many geometric approaches to the problem.},

The graph realizability problem remains \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete if all edges have unit length, which implies that recognizing unit distance graphs is \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete. We also consider the problem for linkages: In a realization of a linkage, vertices are allowed to overlap and lie on the interior of edges. Linkage realizability is \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete and remains so if all edges have unit length. A linkage is called rigid if any slight perturbation of its vertices that does not break the linkage (i.e., keeps edge lengths the same) is the result of a rigid motion of the plane. Testing whether a configuration is not rigid is \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete.},
