\section{Geometry}
\label{sec:geom}

The intersection of convex objects is a matter well studied for multiple
subjects. In our case, it is interesting to know some properties about
the intersection of disks, those being convex objects.

A set $S$ is convex if:
$$\forall p,q \in S\  \forall \lambda \in [0,1]: (1-\lambda)p + \lambda q \in S$$
