\section{Geometry}
\label{sec:geom}

The intersection of convex objects is a matter well studied for multiple
subjects. In our case, it is interesting to know some properties about
the intersection of disks, those being convex objects.

A set $S$ is convex if:
$$\forall p,q \in S\  \forall \lambda \in [0,1]: (1-\lambda)p + \lambda q \in S$$.

\subsection{Stabbing}
A \textit{stabbing} is a point that traverses a set of intersecting objects. A lot of
research has been done \cite{schlipf2013stabbing} on the minimal amount of stabbings to
cover every object in a set. Stabbings can also be done with more complex structures
than points, in that case we're talking about \textit{coverings}.

\begin{theorem}[Helly]
  Given a set $Q$ of objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if for each subset of $Q$ of
  size $d+1$ their intersection is non empty, then $\bigcap_{q \in Q} \neq
  \varnothing$. \cite{Helly1923175}
