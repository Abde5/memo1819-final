\section{Graphs and disks}


\subsection{Graphs}

A graph $G$ is defined as $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ the set of edges. A vertex $v \in V$ is the fundamental unit of a graph. An edge $e \in E$ is a structures that links two vertices. The vertices $vw \in V$ that $e \in E$ links are called the \textit{endpoints}.

\begin{defn}
  An embedding of a graph $G$ is a representation of this graph on the plane.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  A graph $G$ is planar iff there is an embedding of this graph that doesn't have any crossing between the edges.
\end{defn}


\subsection{Intersection graphs}

% This is an example of how you would use tgrind to include an example
% of source code; it is commented out in this template since the code
% example file does not exist.  To use it, you need to remove the '%' on the
% beginning of the line, and insert your own information in the call.

Given a geometric construction with multiple objects, an intersection graph is a graph that maps the objects into vertices and every intersection between objects is an edge between the corresponding vertices.

\begin{defn}
  A graph $G$ is a comparibility graph if there is a partial order... (check c-strip article, good definition).
\end{defn}
