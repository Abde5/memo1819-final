\section{Graph theory}

A \emph{graph} is defined as a tuple $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of \emph{vertices} and $E$. When the the set of \emph{edges}, where $E = \binom{V}{2}$. If two vertices are share the same edge $e$ they are called \emph{adjacent} and also the \emph{endpoints} of $e$. A \emph{subgraph} $H = (V', E')$ of a graph $G$ is a graph such that $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$. An \emph{induced subgraph} of a graph is a subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ such that for every edge of $G$ is also in $H$ if its two endpoints are in $V'$. A \emph{clique} is a subgraph such that every vertex is adjacent to each other. A graph that is also a clique is called a \emph{complete graph} and it is denoted as $K_n$. A graph is \emph{bipartite} if there exist two disjoint subsets of the vertex set $A \cup B = V$ such that two vertices of the same subset are not adjacent. A \emph{complete bipartite graph} $K_{n,m}$ is a bipartite graph such that $v \in A$ and $w \in B$ implies $vw \in E$ where $n$ and $m$ are the size of each bipartition.

A \emph{path} $P_n = v_1\dots v_{n+1}$ of a graph is a sequence of $n$ vertices such that two consequent vertices are adjacent. A \emph{cycle} is a path $C_n = v_1\dots v_nv_{n+1}$ such that $v_1=v_{n+1}$. A graph is \emph{connected} if there exists a path between every pair of vertices. A \emph{chord} of a cycle $C_n$ with $n \geqslant 4$ is an edge that connects two non adjacent vertices of the cycle. A graph is \emph{chordal} if there is a chord in every cycle bigger than four.

An \emph{intersection graph} is a graph $G = (\zeta,E)$ of a collection of objects $\zeta$ is a graph such that $v,w \in \zeta$ and $v \cup w \neq \varnothing$ implies that $vw \in E$. An \emph{interval graph} is an intersection graph of intervals on the plane; when the size of the intervals is equal they are called \emph{unit interval graphs}. A \emph{unit disk graph} is an intersection graph of disks on a plane that have the same diameter - you can find an example in Figure \ref{fig:udg}.

\section{Order and set theory}

The \emph{powerset} $\powerset(S)$ of a set $S$ is the set of subsets of $S$. A \emph{partial order} is a binary relation $\leqslant$ over a set $A$ satisfying three axioms:

\begin{itemize}
  \item if $a \leqslant b$ and $b \leqslant a$ then $a = b$ (\emph{antisymmetry}).
  \item if $a \leqslant b$ and $b \leqslant c$ then $a \leqslant c$ (\emph{transitivity}).
  \item $a \leqslant a$ (\emph{reflexivity}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

  % poset
  \draw (-1cm,0cm) node (v2) {$\{x\}$};
  \draw (1cm,0cm)  node (v3) { $\{y\}$ };
  \draw (0cm,-1cm) node (v4) {$\varnothing$};
  \draw (0cm,1cm)  node (v1) {$\{x,y\}$};

  \draw[thick]  (v1) edge (v2);
  \draw[thick]  (v3) edge (v1);
  \draw[thick]  (v3) edge (v4);
  \draw[thick]  (v2) edge (v4);

  \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill,label distance=1cm] (v2g) at (3.5,-1) {};
  \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill,label distance=1cm] (v3g) at (4.5,0) {};
  \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill,label distance=1cm] (v4g) at (2.5,0) {};
  \draw  (v1g) edge (v2g);
  \draw  (v1g) edge (v4g);
  \draw  (v4g) edge (v2g);
  \draw  (v1g) edge (v3g);
  \draw  (v3g) edge (v2g);

\end{figure}

In the other side, a \emph{total order} is a partial order where the reflexivity order is replaced by the \emph{connexity} property -- $a \leq b\ \text{or}\  b \leq a$. A \emph{partially ordered set} (or \emph{poset}) $(S,\leqslant)$ is a set such that the elements of $S$ are partially ordered by the relation $\leqslant$. A good way to represent a poset is the \emph{Hasse diagram} (figure \ref{fig:hasse}).

\subsection{Comparability graphs}

A \emph{spanning order} $(V,<)$ on a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a total order on $V$ such that for any three vertices $u < v < w$:

  $$uw \in E \to uv \in E\ \text{or}\ vw \in E$$

The class of comparability graphs are built on the ideas of order theory. A graph $G$ is a \emph{comparability graph} if there exists a partial order $\leqslant$ such that $uv \in E \Leftrightarrow v \leqslant w\  \text{or}\  w \leqslant v$.
