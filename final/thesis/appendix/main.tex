\chapter{Problems in inclusion}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG $\subsetneq$ UUIG }: Hayashi \cite {hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}
   \item \textbf{MUIG $\neq$ TTLG (Open)}: To prove that MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG, Hayashi \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017} could simulate MUIGs with 4 different levels. Having only two levels, I conjecture that this is not possible. However, MUIG can have $C_4$, so an inclusion between these two classes is impossible (it has to be rewritten).
   \item \textbf{TTLG $\subsetneq$ TSG (Open)}: This problem has been solved in my thesis by finding a forbidden graph for TTLG, theorem 4.1.3.
   \item \textbf{TLG $\subset$ TSG (Open)}: This is a plausible stronger statement than the one before. However, this result could make the study of TTLG less relevant. Thus, this result would imply:

   $$G \in \text{TLG}(j) \to G \in \text{SG}(k) : j,k \in \mathbb{R}$$
 \end{itemize}

\chapter{Problems in forbidden induced subgraph characterization}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MUIG}: Joos \cite{joosCharacterizationMixedUnit2013} gives us a complete characterization of forbidden graphs.
    \item \textbf{TSG (Open)}: Hayashi \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017} says that MUIG's forbidden induced subgraphs also are in TSG. He claims that finding a graph $F \in (\text{UDG}\cap\text{UUIG}) \setminus \text{TSG}$ could be a good starting point. In my thesis I show that a forbidden induced subgraph for MUIG is in $\text{UDG}\cap\text{UUIG}$.
    \item \textbf{TTLG (Open)}: There are many properties about these graphs in Breu's thesis \cite{breuAlgorithmicAspectsConstrained1996}.
    \item \textbf{UDG (Open)}: There is no complete characterization of UDG. Can the results of this thesis help find new ones?U
  \end{itemize}

  \chapter{Problems in complexity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{UIG/IG recognition}: Both of these problems are polynomial.
      \item \textbf{MUIG recognition}: Schuchat et al. give a linear algorithm ($O(|V|^2)$) to recognise MUIGs \cite{shuchatUnitMixedInterval2014}.
      \item \textbf{UDG recognition}: $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete \cite{ExistentialTheoryReals2006}.
      \item \textbf{SG($c$) recognition (Open)}: Breu  \cite{breuAlgorithmicAspectsConstrained1996} states that SG($c$) recognition is polynomial if a complement edge orientation and a mapping $\phi : V \to [0,c]$ is polynomial as an input of the decision problem.
      \item \textbf{TSG recognition (Open)}: Can we get rid of the mapping as input to recognise TSGs? In that case the problem would be at least NP.
      \item \textbf{UUIG recognition (Open)}: Informally the recognition of this class of graphs \textbf{cannot} be polynomial because we have to find all the cliques of the graph; the CLIQUE problem is NP-complete.
    \end{itemize}
