\chapter{$\sigma$-SG($c$)}

To better characterize SG($c$) and TSG we can define a new class of graphs: $\sigma$-SG($c$).

$\sigma$-SG($c$) are unit disk graphs such that the center of the disks belong to $\{(x,y): -\inf < x < \inf, y \in \{0,c\}\}$, so more intuitively we can say that the center of the disks are placed on two parallel horizontal lines.

\section{Characterization of $\sigma$-SG($c$)}

\prop {An $\sigma$-SG($c$) graph $G$ (with $c < 1$) can be characterized by computing $\delta : A \times B \to E$ where $A,B \subseteq G$, $A$ and $B$ are UIG, and $A \cup B = \varnothing$:

\[
    \delta(x,y) =
    \begin{cases}
      xy        & \text{if } \text{dist}(x,y) \leq 1\\
      \varnothing,       & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
}

\proof{ (Idea) Let's take two subsets $A,B \subseteq G$ being $G$ a SG($c$)...  Both of these subsets (A and B are UIG, because each element in each of these subsets is in the same line).

\lemma{All realization of $C_4$ as a $\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$) is divided in two groups of two consecutive vertices where the points are
located on the same line.}

\proof{
  First, we prove that there is no realization of a different arrangement for $G = C_4$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{4-0:} When every center of unit disks is located in the same line it is considered an UIG.
    This is equal to stating that $C_4 \in$ UIG, which is impossible by Theorem \ref{theo:intervalChord}.
    \item \textbf{3-1:} We define $a,b,c \in V(G)$ as the group of three consecutive points in one line ($y=0$). We know that $c_x > a_x+1$; $ac \notin E(G)$ and $a_x < b_x < c_x$ (so $a_x$ the is the leftmost vertex and $c_x$ the rightmost one).

    We suppose that $d \in V(G)$ and ${ad,cd} \in E(G)$. Because $bd \notin E(G)$, $d_x \in \mathbb{R}\setminus [b_x-\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2},b_x+\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}]$.\\
    If $d_x > b_x + \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}$: $ad \notin E(G)$ because $a_x < b_x$ and $d_x > b_x + \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2} > a_x + \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}$.\\
    Else if $d_x < b_x - \sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}$: $cd \notin E(G)$ with the same development.
    Therefore, it is not possible to have a $C_4$ with the 3-1 configuration.
  \end{itemize}

\theorem{$\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$) $\subsetneq$ TSG}
\todo[inline]{prove with 2 clique adjacency}

\proof{By definition, we know that $\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$) $\subset$ TSG because the area where the disks can be placed in $\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$) is included in the area in TSG.

We can prove that $\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$) $\neq$ TSG because we can construct a graph $G$ such that $G \in$ TSG and $G \notin$ $\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$). This graph $F$ is a net$^*$ graph as described in Figure \ref{fig:forbSigma}.
\begin{proofpart}
  $F$ is a TSG because we can realize it as a TSG if we take as center of disks $(0,0)$, $(0,z)$, $(0,\epsilon)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,z)$, $(1,\epsilon)$ such that $0 < z < \epsilon$.
\end{proofpart}
\begin{proofpart}
  Now we have to prove that $F$ is a forbidden induced subgraph of $\sigma$-SG($\epsilon$). We will try to construct it by taking a induced subgraph that is representable: we take $F_{-1} = F - x$ with $x\in V(F)$. We notice that $V(F_{-1})$ is $C_{4}$ ($abcd$) with a vertex $e$ adjacent to any two consecutive vertices $x,y \in V(C_4)$ creating the triangle $xye$.\\
  The only way to realize this is by taking $a = (0,0)$, $b = (0,\epsilon)$, $c = (1,\epsilon)$, $d = (1,0)$ and $e$...
