\end{fquote}

The goal of this chapter is to introduce the main subject of this thesis. \emph{\index{Thin strip graphs}} is a class of graphs that lie between unit disk graphs
and mixed interval graphs. We can define formally a \emph{\index{$c$-strip graph}} as a unit disk graph such that the centers of the disks belong to $\{(x,y) : -\infty < x < \infty, 0 \leq y \leq c\}$, more intuitively we can see this as a unit disk graph where the centers of the disks lie between two parallel horizontal lines with a distance of $c$ between them. We denote this class by SG($c$). We have then that SG($0$) = UIG and SG($\infty$) = UDG.

The definition and main work for this class comes from Breu in his thesis \cite{breuAlgorithmicAspectsConstrained1996}. However, Hayashi \textit{et al.} \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017} expand his work by defining the class of thin strip graphs. Also, a first review of unit disk graphs will be done in the first section of this chapter, based on the original paper of Clark \textit{et al.} \cite{CLARK1990165} where unit disks graphs were defined with some interesting results.

\section{Unit disk graphs}

An \emph{\index{unit disk graph}} is an intersection graph of equal-sized disks on a plane - also called \emph{unitary}. The main interest of this class of graphs is its application. They can be used to create a graph-theoretic model for any kind broadcast networks. This can be useful in the case where a broadcast node needs to have a different frequency from another broadcast node that is close enough. With the unit disk graph model, we can solve this with algorithms for well known graph-theoretic problems like the coloration problem.

The most studied problem for this class of graphs is its recognition and characterization. It has been proven that its recognition problem is \index{$\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete} \cite{Schaefer2013}. In the other hand, its characterization is still not complete and an open question. Atminas \textit{et al.} tackled this problem by finding forbidden subgraphs to some of its subclasses \cite{atminasForbiddenInducedSubgraphs2016}. However, since its definition, we know that some graph-theoretic problems have different complexity when applied to unit disk graphs like the CLIQUE problem which has been proven to be polynomial when applied to UDGs \cite{CLARK1990165}. The approximation complexity of these problems has also been studied \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-05010}.

\section{$c$-strip graphs}

A $c$-strip graph can be defined as a unit disk graph such that the centers of the disks are located between two horizontal parallel lines with a distance of $c$ between both of them.


\section{Thin strip graphs}

A thin strip graph can be intuitively defined as a $c$-strip graph where $c$ is an arbitrarily little $\varepsilon$. Also, we can see that SG($k$) $\subseteq$ SG($l$) with $k<l$. A more strict definition emerges from this observation:

\begin{defn}
  Thin strip graphs are defined as TSG $= \bigcap_{c > 0}$ SG($c$).
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
  SG($0$) $\neq$ TSG. We can construct a $K_{1,3}$ such that we have 3 vertices with the coordinates
  $(1,0)$, $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$ and a last one $(0,\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon > 0$ and arbitrarily small
  as seen in Figure \ref{fig:thinK13}.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  There is no constant $t$ such that SG($t$) = TSG.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  There is no constant $t$ such that SG($t$) = UDG.
\end{theorem}

Hayashi et al. left some open problems. We try to expand the knowledge around some of these problems
to understand them better, largely for the recognition of this class of graphs. Before that, we see where this class lays in the hierarchy of classes. We know by definition that TSG $\subsetneq$ UDG.

\subsection{Interval graphs}

Thin strip graphs shares their geometrical structure with interval graphs (remember SG($0$) = UIG). In this subsection, we overview the results of Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017} where they find maximal and minimal superclasses for TSG in the interval graphs presented in chapter \ref{chap:interval}. The following theorem will be proven by taking the proof written by Hayashi et al. in order to use their mapping in other theorems (e.g. \ref{chap:twolevel}).

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  \label{theo:muigTSG}
  MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG.
\end{theorem}

\proof{
First, we prove that MUIG $\neq$ TSG. This can be proven because $C_4 \in$ TSG if we take as points $(0,0),(0,\varepsilon),(1,0),(1,\varepsilon)$ with $1 >\varepsilon > 0$ and $C_4 \notin$ MUIG because it is a chordal graph.

Then, we have to prove that MUIG $\subseteq$ TSG. Let $G = (V,E) \in$ MUIG where each vertex is a unit mixed interval denoted as $I_v$. We define $t = \min\{|I_u\cap I_v| : |I_u\cap I_v| > 0, \{I_u,I_v\} \subseteq V\}$ and $s = \min\{\ell(I_v) - r(I_u) : \ell(I_v) > r(I_u), \{I_u,I_v\} \subseteq V\}$. We have then $t$ being the minimum length of an intersection bigger than zero (that is, not endpoint-adjacent) and $s$ is the minimum distance between non-adjacent vertices (also not endpoint-adjacent). We also define $c(I_v) = \frac{\ell(I_v) + r(I_v)}{2}$ as the center of the interval and $p(I_v) = (-1)^{\left \lfloor{c(I_v)}\right \rfloor }$.

Let $d$ be a real such that $0 < d < \frac{2}{3}$, $d\leq \frac{t}{4}$, $d < \frac{s}{2}$ and $\varepsilon \geq 2\sqrt{d-d^2}$. If we let $h = \sqrt{d-d^2}$, then we can create a $2h$-realization of $G$ with the following mapping:

\[ \phi(v) =
  \begin{cases}
      (c(I_v),0) & \text{if}\  I_v\  \text{is a closed interval} \\
      (c(I_v),hp(I_v)) & \text{if}\  I_v\  \text{is an open interval} \\
      (c(I_v)-d,hp(I_v)) & \text{if}\  I_v\  \text{is a closed-open interval} \\
      (c(I_v)+d,hp(I_v)) & \text{if}\  I_v\  \text{is an open-closed interval}
   \end{cases}
\]

For two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ such that $u \leq v$, we have the three following cases:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $r(I_u) < \ell(I_v)$:

    $I_u$ and $I_v$ are not adjacents, which means that $\text{dist}(\phi(u),\phi(v)) > 1$.
    If we minimize the distance between them we have $\phi(u) = (c(I_u)+d,hp(I_u))$ and $\phi(v) = (c(I_v)-d,hp(I_v))$ with $p(I_u) = p(I_v)$. Therefore, we only have to compare their $x$-coordinates:

    $$\text{dist}(\phi(u),\phi(v)) \geq (c(I_v)-d) - (c(I_u)+d) = c(I_v)-c(I_u) - 2d$$

    By definition, $s \leq l(I_v)-r(I_u)$. If we take the centers, then $s \leq c(I_v)-c(I_u) -1$, which means finally that $s +1 \leq c(I_v)-c(I_u)$

    $$\text{dist}(\phi(u),\phi(v)) \geq s + 1 - 2d > 1$$

  \item $r(I_u) > \ell(I_v)$:
    In this case $u$ and $v$ are adjacent. We maximize $\text{dist}(\phi(u),\phi(v))$ when $\phi(u) = (c(I_u)-d,hp(I_u))$ and $\phi(v) = (c(I_v)+d,hp(I_v))$ with $p(I_u) \neq p(I_v)$. Therefore,

\[    \begin{split}
    \text{dist}(\phi(u),\phi(v)) & \leq \sqrt{((c(I_v)+d)-(c(I_u)-d))^2 + (h+h)^2} \\
     & \text{with the same reasoning as before}\  c(I_v)-c(I_u) \leq 1-t\\
     & \leq \sqrt{(1-t+2d)^2 + 4h^2} \\
     & \leq \sqrt{(1-4d+2d)^2 + 4(d-d^2)} \\
     & = \sqrt{1-4d+4d^2 + 4d-4d^2} = 1
    \end{split}
\]

  \item $r(I_u) = \ell(I_v)$:

  In this case, $u$ and $v$ are adjacent only if $r(I_u)$ and $I_v$ are closed. We know that $c(I_v) = c(I_u)+1$ and $p(I_u) \neq p(I_v)$. Without loss of generality, we suppose that $p(I_u) = 1$ and $p(I_v) = -1$. We have two cases:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Both ends are closed. So we have this set of possible assignments for each one of the vertices:

    $$\phi(u) \in \{(c(I_u),0), (c(I_u)+d,h)\}$$
    $$\phi(v) \in \{(c(I_u)+1,0), (c(I_u)+1-d,-h)\}$$
    This gives us a rectangle with its diagonal smaller than one.

\item One of the ends is closed, we suppose $r(I_u)$ is open. In this case, we have these solutions:

  $$\phi(u) \in \{(c(I_u)-d,h), (c(I_u),h)\}$$
  $$\phi(v) \in \{(c(I_u)+1,0), (c(I_u)+1,-h), (c(I_u)+1\pm d,-h)\}$$

  Every distance between every points is greater than 1 if we take into consideration the domain of $d$. \qed

  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
}

From this theorem, UIG $\subsetneq$ TSG. Actually, there exists a stronger connection between these two classes:

\begin{theorem}[Breu \cite{breuAlgorithmicAspectsConstrained1996}]
  \label{theo:induced_TSG}
  Let $G$ a $c$-strip graph with $c \in \mathbb{R}_0^+$. $G$ has an induced $K_{1,3}$ or $C_4$ if and only if $G$ is not an unit interval graph.
\end{theorem}

Thin strip graphs can also be seen as unfettered unit interval graphs, which means that if a graph is a thin strip graph, then we can partition this graph with a level structure where each level is a clique. This information will be relevant in the next section.

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  TSG $\subsetneq$ UUIG.
\end{theorem}

\proof{See \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}.}

\section{Characterization of thin strip graphs}

One of the main goals of this thesis is to characterize thin strip graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs. We know that TSG is an hereditary class, then a way to characterize this class of graphs is by looking for its forbidden subgraphs the same way as MUIG has been characterized by Joos. Furthermore, MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG by Theorem \ref{theo:muigTSG}, so the first we can do is to check if the forbidden subgraphs of MUIG are also for TSG.


\subsection{Mixed unit interval graph forbidden subgraphs}

In the previous section we have shown that MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG \ref{theo:muigTSG}. We have even shown every forbidden induced subgraph of MUIG in Chapter \ref{chap:interval}. Here we are going to overview these forbidden induced subgraphs and we their inclusion in TSG. Moreover, we will verify if one of these families is at least in UUIG.

In this subsection, we are going to see the relationship between thin strip graphs and mixed unit interval graphs.

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  $\mathcal{R}$ is a forbidden induced subgraph family of UUIG.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We can prove this by induction on $i$.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Case $i=0$}: $R_0 \notin$ UUIG because there is no clique partition of $R_0$ that is also a level structure as seen in Figure \ref{fig:R0level}.
    \item \emph{Case $i = i+1$}: We suppose that every valid clique partition of $R_i$ is not a level structure. See in Figure \ref{fig:ri+1} the edges and vertices that we add to generate $R_{i+1}$. We call $a,b$ the vertices that were disjoint in $R_i$ and $c,d$ the new vertices. These two vertices are adjacent to $b$.

    Let $\{b,c\}$ or $\{b,d\}$ be a level of our clique partition. By the hypothesis of induction we know that this is partition is not a level structure because this partition is a valid partition of $R_i$ because $a$ and $b$ are in different levels. The only way to create a new partition that is not a valid clique partition of $R_i$ is if $\{a,b\}$ is a level. In this case, however, the clique level $\{a,b\}$ will be adjacent to three cliques $\{c\}, \{d\}$ and $\{e, \dots\}$ so this clique partition is not a level structure either.
  \end{itemize}

  This proves that $R_i$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}_0$ has not a clique level structure; thus, it is not an UUIG.
\end{proof}

We see that $\mathcal{R}$ is a family of forbidden subgraphs of TSG. Nevertheless, the rest of the forbidden subgraphs for MUIG are thin strip graphs. The main reason is because they are unfettered unit interval graphs. We see our first example with the forbidden graph for MUIG $F$.

\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
  $F \in$ TSG.
\end{theorem}

\proof{
To prove this we have to find an $\varepsilon$-realization for our graph $F = (V,E)$ with $\varepsilon$ arbitrarily small. Let $\phi(v)$ be the mapping of our vertices on the plane. $F$ has a level structure $L = \{\{u_0, u_1\}, \{v_0, v_1, v_2\}, \{w\}\}$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:graphF_clique}.

We begin to construct the representation as a thin strip graph by placing the vertices $v_0, v_1, v_2$ on the plane. Simply, we place them on the same $x$ coordinate with an equal distance from $v_0$ to $v_1$ and $v_1$ to $v_2$ such that they are all adjacent, being those on a $y$ coordinate smaller than $\varepsilon$:

$$\phi(v_k) = \Bigg(0, \varepsilon \frac{k}{2}\Bigg)$$

for $k \in \{0,1,2\}$.\\

We continue with $w$; $w$ has to be adjacent to $v_0$ and $v_1$, but not $v_2$. We pursue to place it on a $y$ coordinate that is located in the middle between $0$ and $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ (the $y$ coordinates of $v_0$ and $v_1$), which is $\frac{\varepsilon}{4}$. Now we have to find a $x$ coordinate for $w$ such that it touches both $v_0$ and $v_1$ but does not intersect with $v_2$. By symmetry, we only have to check the adjacency of $v_0$ and $v_2$. We can calculate a point such that the distance between $w$ and $v_0$ equals one:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \sqrt{\phi(w)_y^2 + \Big(\frac{\varepsilon}{4}\Big)^2} &= 1\\
    \phi(w)_x^2 + \Big(\frac{\varepsilon}{4}\Big)^2 &= 1\\
    \phi(w)_x^2 &= 1 - \Big(\frac{\varepsilon}{4}\Big)^2\\
    \phi(w)_x &= \sqrt{1 - \Big(\frac{\varepsilon}{4}\Big)^2}\\
    \phi(w)_x &= \sqrt{\frac{16 - \varepsilon^2}{16}}\\
    \phi(w)_x &= \frac{\sqrt{16 - \varepsilon^2}}{4}\\
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

and by symmetry, $-\frac{\sqrt{16 - \varepsilon^2}}{4}$ is also a candidate. We only have to see if it touches $v_2$ for every $\varepsilon$:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \sqrt{\Bigg(\frac{\sqrt{16 - \varepsilon^2}}{4}\Bigg)^2 + \varepsilon^2} &> 1\\
    \sqrt{\frac{16 - \varepsilon^2}{16} + \varepsilon^2} &> 1\\
    \sqrt{\frac{16 - \varepsilon^2 + 16\varepsilon}{16}} &> 1\\
    \sqrt{\frac{16 + 15\varepsilon^2}{16}} &> 1\\
    \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{16 + 15\varepsilon^2} &> 1\\
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

the expression on the left will always be bigger than one if $\varepsilon \neq 0$, which means that $w$ will never be adjacent to $v_2$.

$$\phi(w) = \Bigg(\frac{\sqrt{16 - \varepsilon^2}}{4}, \frac{\varepsilon}{4}\Bigg)$$

Finally, we have to place $u_0, u_1$. We can remark that the neighbours of $u_1$ in the second level correspond to the neighbours of $w$ , so it will be placed symmetrically with respect to 0 with the same $y$ coordinate, as we have proven before. Finally, $u_0$ has to be adjacent to $v_0$. We can place it at $(-1,0)$ with the same argument as the construction of $K_{1,3}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:thinK13}). The other vertices of the second level $v_1$ and $v_2$ will not be adjacent to $u_0$ unless their $y$ coordinate is 0, which is not the case.

$$\phi(u_1) = \Bigg(-\frac{\sqrt{16 - \varepsilon^2}}{4}, \frac{\varepsilon}{4}\Bigg)$$
$$\phi(u_2) = (-1, 0)$$

You can find a visual representation of this graph in Figure \ref{fig:graphF_thin}. \qed
}


To prove the realization of $\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S''}$ as thin strip graphs, we first must define a new family of graphs. The family of graphs $\mathcal{Q}$ can be defined as a $K_{1,3}$ where two of its vertices of degree one are cliques. You can find an example in Figure \ref{fig:graph_Q}.

\begin{claim}\label{claim:graph_Q}
  The family of graphs $\mathcal{Q}$ is a subset of the class of thin strip graphs and can be realized such that the position of every vertex is different.
\end{claim}

\proof{
We proceed to realize $Q_{1,1}$ and $Q_{2,2}$ as thin strip graphs. With their realizations we can also deduce the realization of $Q_{i,j}$ for every $i,j \in \mathbb{N}_0$. The clique of size $i$ is called $A$ and the clique of size $j$ is called $B$ based on Figure \ref{fig:graph_Q}.

$Q_{1,1}$ is $K_{1,3}$ and it has been shown that it is realizable as a thin strip graph with coordinates $(0,0), (-1,0), (1,0), (0,\varepsilon)$ for $\varepsilon > 0$. We can realize $Q_{i,j}$ if the position of every vertex in $A$ equals $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$ for $B$. However, we want that every vertex of $A$ and $B$ has a different position, so we proceed to construct a realization that holds for $Q_{2,2}$.

Let $a,b,c,d$ be the vertices of a graph $K_{1,3}$ where $c$ is the vertex of highest degree. $a$ and $b$ are the leftmost and rightmost vertices when realized as a thin strip graph, so their positions are $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$ respectively and $c$ is the top disk with coordinates $(0, \varepsilon)$ as seen in Figure \ref{fig:graph_Q_real}. If we add now the vertices $e$ and $f$ with the same neighbourhood as $a$ and $b$, we have to find out how much they can move with respect to $a$ and $b$ to still be in contact with $d$ and not with $c$. We can build this new position by taking the same $y$-coordinate as $a$ and $b$, so for the moment $\phi_y(e) = 0$ and $\phi_y(f) = 0$. We can see that the procedure is the same for $e$ and $f$ by symmetry, so we are going to prove this for $e$.

If $\phi_y(e)=0$, then we have to find $\phi_x(e)$ such that $e$ is not in contact with $c$ with a position $\phi(c) = (0, \varepsilon)$.

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \sqrt{\phi_x(e)^2 + \varepsilon^2} &> 1\\
    \phi_x(e)^2 + \varepsilon^2 &> 1\\
    \phi_x(e)^2 &> 1 - \varepsilon^2\\
    \phi_x(e) &> \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2}\ \ \text{or}\ \  \phi_x(e) < -\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

with $\varepsilon > 0$.

With this, we can see that $\phi_x(e) \in (-1, -\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2})$ and $\phi_x(f) \in (\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2},1)$. To finalize this proof, we can see that every vertex of $v \in A$ such that $\phi_x(v)\in (-1, -\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2})$, we have infinitely different positions to choose. The same holds for $B$. \qed

\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
  $\mathcal{T}$ is a family of thin strip graphs.
\end{theorem}

\proof{
We take as a reference $T_{4,2}$ in Figure \ref{fig:graph_T_clique}. We can partition this graph in three parts: the \emph{hands} (blue), the \emph{arms} (green) and the \emph{diamond} in the center (red). You may notice that the "hands" are actually $Q_{2,1}$ from Claim \ref{claim:graph_Q}. We begin placing the left "hand" by minimizing the $x$-coordinate of the fifth node as stated in the claim, we give it a $x$-coordinate with value:

$$\tau_0 = \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2} + \delta$$

with $0 < \delta < 1 - \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2}$. And its $y$-coordinate equals 0, following the same procedure as in the claim.

Next, we place the disks that represent the "arm" of our graph. We place them by clique levels of two indexed by $i \geqslant 1$ from left to right with respect to Figure \ref{fig:graph_T_clique}. The $y$-coordinate of the entire arm equals $0$, it is actually an unit interval graph. We only have to set the $x$-coordinate of each one of the disks $u_i,v_i$ of our level indexed by $i$. The disk $u_i$ will be placed at the $x$-coordinate $i+1$, it will be adjacent to $u_{i-1}$ or the rightmost vertex of the "hand" if $i = 1$. On the other hand, our second disk $v_i$ will be placed in the $x$-coordinate:

$$\tau_i = \tau_{i-1} + 1 + \delta$$

with $0 < \delta < i - \tau_{i-1}$ so that $v_i$ will be on the left of $u_i$. We do this consecutively for each level until we arrive to the diamond. The two leftmost vertices of the diamond are built as a level of the "arm". However, the right two vertices have the same coordinates of the left ones but shifted by one on the $x$-coordinate. By symmetry, the right arm is built equally, by taking care that the last level corresponds with the coordinates of the diamond. You can find the realization of $T_{4,2}$ as a thin strip graph in Figure \ref{fig:graph_T_realization}.
}

This proof will be used as a basis that we are going to use to construct the realization of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{S''}$ because as you can see, their structure is very similar. Actually, the "hand" and "arm" that have been used during the proof are directly applicable for the other graphs.

\begin{theorem}
  $\mathcal{S}$ is a family of thin strip graphs.
\end{theorem}

\proof{
In this case, we are going to construct $S_1$ and $S_i$ with $i > 1$ differently. For $S_1$, we build the induced $Q_{2,1}$ as described on \ref{fig:graph_S1_clique}. Then, we add another disk on the center such that its $y$-coordinate is bigger than $0$ and smaller than $\varepsilon$ with a certain value that it touches the left disk as shown in Figure \ref{fig:graph_S1_realization}.

In the other hand, for $S_i$ with $i > 1$ the construction is quite different. Indeed, we can see by Figure \ref{fig:graph_S4_clique} that the "arm" and "hand" subgraphs are exactly the same as for $\mathcal{T}$ in Figure \ref{fig:graph_T_clique}. The same construction works in this case. Now, we only have to build the red subgraph of $S_i$ as shown in the Figure.

\begin{theorem}
  $\mathcal{S''}$ is a family of thin strip graphs.
\end{theorem}

\proof{
We take as a reference $T_{4,2}$ in Figure \ref{fig:graph_T_clique}. We can partition this graph in three parts: the \emph{hands} (blue), the \emph{arms} (green) and the \emph{diamond} in the center (red). You may notice that the "hands" are actually $Q_{2,1}$ from Claim \ref{claim:graph_Q}. We begin placing the left "hand" by minimizing the $x$-coordinate of the fifth node as stated in the claim, we give it a $x$-coordinate bigger than $\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2} + \delta$ with $\delta < 1 - \sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2}$. Then we place

\section{Recognition}

The recognition of this class of graphs is approached by Breu in his thesis \cite{breuAlgorithmicAspectsConstrained1996}. He gives a polynomial-time algorithm to recognise strip graphs for a given input with an assignment of $y$-coordinates for each vertex of the graph and an orientation of the edges of its complement.

\begin{theorem}[Breu \cite{breuAlgorithmicAspectsConstrained1996}]
  Let $G = (V,E,\gamma,\overrightarrow{E})$ a graph where $\gamma: V \to [0,c]$ is a function associating a $y$-coordinate (or a level) to each vertex and $\overrightarrow{E}$ an orientation of the complement of the graph. The recognition of $c$-strip graphs with this input is in $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{obs}
  Recognition of $c$-strip graphs without a given $\overrightarrow{E}$ is in $\mathcal{NP}$.
\end{obs}

\proof{
  Given a polynomial-time algorithm with a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(f(n))$ to solve recognition of $G = (V,E,\gamma,\overrightarrow{E})$, we can run again this algorithm by testing every possible orientation of its complement. This algorithm would take $\mathcal{O}(f(n))2^{|E|-1} = \mathcal{O}(f(n)2^{|E|})$ time to execute. \qed
}\\

We would like to have an algorithm that solves this problem without knowing the $y$-coordinates of the vertices. Nevertheless, further research would concentrate on recognition of UUIGs. We know that TSG $\subsetneq$ UUIG, and recognition of UUIGs is $\mathcal{NP}$. If we the problem of recognising TSG given a UUIG and is solved in polynomial time, then TSG recognition would be $\mathcal{NP}$. However, given the observations in the end of chapter \ref{chap:interval}, there may be a polynomial-time algorithm for UUIG.
