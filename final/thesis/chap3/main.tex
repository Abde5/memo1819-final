\todo{Explain Breu's characterization of strip graphs}

$c$-strip graphs are unit disk graphs such that the centers of the disks belong to
$\{(x,y) : -\infty < x < \infty, 0 \leq y \leq c\}$. The class is denoted by SG($c$). We
have SG(0) = UIG and SG($\infty$) = UDG. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}

\begin{defn}
  Thin strip graphs are defined as TSG $= \bigcap_{c > 0}$ SG($c$).
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
  SG($0$) $\neq$ TSG. We can construct a $K_{1,3}$ such that we have 3 vertices with the coordinates
  $(1,0)$, $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$ and a last one $(0,\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon > 0$ and arbitrarily small
  as seen in Figure \ref{fig:thinK13}.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  There is no constant $t$ such that SG($t$) = TSG.
\end{theorem}

Since this class is newly defined we have to characterize it. For this purpose,
some relations have been found between this class and interval graphs.

\subsection{Interval graphs}

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  MUIG $\subsetneq$ TSG.
\end{theorem}

We can define a new class of graphs: unfettered unit interval graphs. These graphs
are unit interval graphs where if two intersections touch, we can decide whether
they intersect or not. We denote this class UUIG.

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  TSG $\subsetneq$ UUIG.
\end{theorem}


\section{Characterization of thin strip graphs}

One of the main goals of this thesis is to characterize TSG. by forbidden induced subgraphs. To approach this, we will see how many induced forbidden subgraphs are also forbidden for TSG. We have described the familes of forbidden induced subgraphs for MUIG in section \ref{sec:muig} and one of these familes has been proven to be a forbidden induced subgraph for TSG:

\begin{theorem}[Hayashi et al. \cite{hayashiThinStripGraphs2017}]
  $\mathcal{R}$ is a forbidden induced subgraph family of TSG.
\end{theorem}

\caption{A construction of $F$ with a unit disk realization.}
\label{fig:fUDG}
\end{figure}


With the properties presented in this chapter, we can begin to state our first hypothesis:

\begin{hyp}
  $F \in (\text{UDG}\cap\text{UUIG}) \setminus \text{TSG}$.
\end{hyp}

\begin{claim}
 $F \in (\text{UDG}\cap\text{UUIG})$
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
  We can see that $F \in$ UDG because we can have a unit disk realization (Figure \ref{fig:fUDG}) and also has a level structure $L = \{K_2, K_3, K_1\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$F \notin$ TSG.
\end{theorem}

\todo{Symsolver SO HARD.}

To prove this theorem we will first state some claims and observations on behalf of the characteristics of this graph.

\begin{defn}
  The \emph{critical region} of two points is noted as $\alpha_{ab} = \sqrt{1 - (a_y - b_y)^2}$. For a $c$-strip graph we have $\alpha_{ab} \leq \sqrt{1 - c^2}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{obs}
  If a graph $G =(V,E)$ is a diamond with $V = \{a,b,c,d\}$ where $ad \notin E$, then:

  $$\text{dist}(a,d) \leq 2$$

  which also means that

  $$|a_x, d_x| \leq 2\alpha_{ad}$$

  and also, $b_x, c_x \in [a_x, d_x]$.
\end{obs}

\proof{

The distance between $a$ and $d$ has to be at most 2, because there is at least one vertex that is adjacent to both. And clearly, the other points have to be between them because they are adjacent to both, so if they were not.

\section{Recognition}

The recognition of this class of graphs is stated by Breu in his thesis \todo{explain everything about dangerous cycles and
complement oriented graphs in Breu's paper}.
