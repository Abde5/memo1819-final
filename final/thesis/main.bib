The graph realizability problem remains \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete if all edges have unit length, which implies that recognizing unit distance graphs is \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete. We also consider the problem for linkages: In a realization of a linkage, vertices are allowed to overlap and lie on the interior of edges. Linkage realizability is \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete and remains so if all edges have unit length. A linkage is called rigid if any slight perturbation of its vertices that does not break the linkage (i.e., keeps edge lengths the same) is the result of a rigid motion of the plane. Testing whether a configuration is not rigid is \$\$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$\$ -complete.},

  title = {The {{Art Gallery Problem}} Is \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{\vphantom\}{{R}}\vphantom\{\}\$-Complete},
  abstract = {We prove that the art gallery problem is equivalent under polynomial time reductions to deciding whether a system of polynomial equations over the real numbers has a solution. The art gallery problem is a classical problem in computational geometry. Given a simple polygon \$P\$ and an integer \$k\$, the goal is to decide if there exists a set \$G\$ of \$k\$ guards within \$P\$ such that every point \$p$\backslash$in P\$ is seen by at least one guard \$g$\backslash$in G\$. Each guard corresponds to a point in the polygon \$P\$, and we say that a guard \$g\$ sees a point \$p\$ if the line segment \$pg\$ is contained in \$P\$. The art gallery problem has stimulated extensive research in geometry and in algorithms. However, the complexity status of the art gallery problem has not been resolved. It has long been known that the problem is \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}\$-hard, but no one has been able to show that it lies in \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}\$. Recently, the computational geometry community became more aware of the complexity class \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$. The class \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$ consists of problems that can be reduced in polynomial time to the problem of deciding whether a system of polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real variables has a solution. It can be easily seen that \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}$\backslash$subseteq $\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$. We prove that the art gallery problem is \$$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$-complete, implying that (1) any system of polynomial equations over the real numbers can be encoded as an instance of the art gallery problem, and (2) the art gallery problem is not in the complexity class \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}\$ unless \$$\backslash$text\{NP\}=$\backslash$exists $\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$. As a corollary of our construction, we prove that for any real algebraic number \$$\backslash$alpha\$ there is an instance of the art gallery problem where one of the coordinates of the guards equals \$$\backslash$alpha\$ in any guard set of minimum cardinality. That rules out many geometric approaches to the problem.},

  abstract = {At the University Hospital Gynecological Department in Zagreb 1666 cancers of the uterine cervix were treated in the period of 4 years [1969--1972]. Among them were only 309 carcinomas in situ, the remaining 1357 were invasive. The distribution by stages was as follows: IA--75, IB--223, II--326, III--611, IV--122. Such unfavourable groups of cervical cancers proceed from the fact that cancer in situ and the early cancer stage I are often treated in other institutions; only the patients with advanced cancer, a poor general condition and those with various accompanying diseases are concentrated in the above quoted institution where there are technical possibilities and a team of surgeons and radiotherapists well educated in the treatment of cervical cancer. The authors present a five-year survival achieved by surgical, radiological, as well as by a combined method of treatment. The total cure rate for stage I was 87.6\%, for stage II 64,4\%, for stage III 34.4\% and for stage  IV 6.6\%.},

  abstract = {Graphs, such as social networks, word co-occurrence networks, and communication networks, occur naturally in various real-world applications. Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and different patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions. We finally present the open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods, available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides all presented algorithms within a unified interface to foster and facilitate research on the topic.},

  isbn = {978-3-540-45811-1},
  abstract = {The paper presents a new protocol for counting 1-bit secrets without revealing if the bit is 1 or 0 in publicly verifiable way. Other than the conventional multi-party protocols that involve enormous number of rounds and huge bandwidth consumption, the proposed protocol, based on the Mix and Match approach [2] in which computations are dealt with ciphertexts, requires a non-interactive constant number of round and simple but verifiable computation for both of sender and counter. The expected application of proposed protocol is an (one-bit) secret voting in which voters cast a ballot encrypted by a public key and an oblivious party (counter) makes a tally of how many votes are polled. The final tally is represented as a k-digit binary register consisting of k ciphertexts that only collaboration of distributed authorities can decrypt. Opening only the MSB of ciphtertexts allows us to see if more than half voters cast ``Yes'' or not without revealing the details of total number. The cost for opening is O(log n), where n is a number of voters. With the proof of knowledge, voters can prove that the vote is either 1 or 0 without revealing their privacy. The proposed protocol is universally verifiable because any third party can verify that voters, a counter and administrators do not violate the protocol. The protocol is robust against up to a constant number of malicious administrators using standard threshold scheme.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

  abstract = {Commercial aqueous 25\% glutaraldehyde solutions contain no stable derivative of this aldehyde, but compounds of variable molecular weight which easily revert to glutaraldehyde. The effect of pH on the reaction of glutarldehyde with amino acids and on the stability of the products under acid conditions, shows the importance of the structure modification of the dialdehyde which occurs when pH increases, and even leads to precipitation in highly alkaline solutions. This precipitate results from aldol condensation of glutaraldehyde molecules. It contains aldehyd groups conjugated with ethylenic double bonds. Such a structure reacts with amino groups to give an imino bond, stabilized by resonance with the ethylenic bond, and does not undergo Michael-type addition reactions. Therefore, glutaraldehyde does not react with proteins under its free form, but as an unsaturated polymer, which gives imino bonds stabilized by conjugation.},

  title = {Axes-Parallel Unit Disk Graph Recognition Is {{NP}}-Hard},
  abstract = {Unit disk graphs are the intersection graphs of unit diameter disks in the Euclidean plane. Recognizing unit disk graph is an important geometric problem, and has many application areas. In general, this problem is shown to be \$$\backslash$exists$\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$-complete. In some applications, the objects that correspond to unit disks, have predefined (geometrical) structures to be placed on. Hence, many scientists attacked this problem by restricting the domain for the centers of the disks. One example to such applications is wireless sensor networks, where each disk corresponds to a wireless sensor node, and a pair of intersecting disks correspond to a pair of sensors being able to communicate with each other. It is usually assumed that the nodes have identical sensing ranges, and thus unit disk graph model is used to model problems concerning wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we also attack the unit disk recognition problem on a restricted domain, by assuming a scenario where the wireless sensor nodes are deployed on the corridors of a building. Based on this scenario, we impose a geometric constraint such that the unit disks must be centered onto given straight lines. We show that deciding whether there exists a realization of a given graph as unit disk graphs on straight lines is NP-hard, even if the given lines are parallel to either \$x\$-axis or \$y\$-axis. Moreover, we remark that if the straight lines are not given, then the problem becomes \$$\backslash$exists$\backslash$mathbb\{R\}\$-complete.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {0010-8650},
  abstract = {Possibilities of involution of changes in lesser circulation after closure of experimental aortopulmonary anastomosis were studied. 37 observations at various intervals after closure of anastomosis (several minutes to 13.5 months) in 25 dogs were analyzed. Before closure the anastomosis had functioned for 1-7 months. The results of histological examinations of lungs, pressure measurements in lesser circulation, heart weight, electrocardiographic and spirographic examinations were analyzed. It was found that complete involution of changes in lesser circulation was possible only in first month of existence of anastomosis, in this case with changes of both "early" and "late" types. "Late"-type changes after four months function of anastomosis had both reversible and irreversible character, whereas "early"-type changes became irreversible already after three-month duration of anastomosis. With the "late"-type changes, the operation itself (closure of anastomosis) was accompanied by symptoms of pulmonary vasomotor paresis and heart failure, whereas in the presence of "early"-type changes the operation elicited no morphological or functional changes.},

The main contribution of this paper is a fast linear-time deterministic selection algorithm QuickselectAdaptive based on a refined definition of MedianOfMedians. The algorithm's performance brings deterministic selection---along with its desirable properties of reproducible runs, predictable run times, and immunity to pathological inputs---in the range of practicality. We demonstrate results on independent and identically distributed random inputs and on normally-distributed inputs. Measurements show that QuickselectAdaptive is faster than state-of-the-art baselines.},
